# Cursor Rules for Ethos Signals

## Git Commit Policy
- **NEVER commit or push to git automatically**
- **NEVER run `git commit` or `git push` commands without explicit user instruction**
- Only commit when the user explicitly says "commit" or "push" or similar
- This is a production application - all commits must be intentional

## Development Guidelines
- Always test changes locally before suggesting commits
- Ask user before making database changes
- Be careful with production data
