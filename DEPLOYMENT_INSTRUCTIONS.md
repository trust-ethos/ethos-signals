## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Backend Deployment (Auto - 2 minutes)

### Deno Deploy Auto-Deployment

The backend automatically deploys from the main branch.

1. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Go to https://dash.deno.com/projects/signals
   - Check that latest commit (980508f) is deployed
   - Look for "Deployment successful" status

2. **Test API**:
```bash
# Test the count endpoint
curl "https://signals.deno.dev/api/paid-promos/count?tweetUrl=https://x.com/test/status/123"

# Expected: {"total":0,"disclosed":0,"undisclosed":0}
```

3. **Check Logs**:
   - Monitor Deno Deploy logs for any errors
   - Look for successful database connections

### Manual Deployment (if auto-deploy fails)
```bash
# Push to main again
git push origin main

# Or trigger manual deployment from Deno Deploy dashboard
```
