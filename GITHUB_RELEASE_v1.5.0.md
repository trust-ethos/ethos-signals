# Signals v1.5.0 - Paid Promo Disclosure Status

## üéâ What's New

This release adds **disclosure status tracking** for paid promotion reports, helping the community identify undisclosed paid promotions.

### Paid Promo Disclosure Status

When reporting a tweet as a paid promo, users can now specify:
- ‚úÖ **Disclosed** - Content clearly states it's a paid partnership
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Undisclosed** - Content doesn't mention it's paid

### Why This Matters

Undisclosed paid promotions can mislead investors. By tracking disclosure status, the Signals community can identify content that may not be fully transparent and promote better practices in the crypto space.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üéØ Disclosure Status Selection
- Easy-to-use toggle buttons in the extension dialog
- "Disclosed" is pre-selected by default
- Visual feedback with color-coded buttons (green/red)

### üìä Enhanced Tweet Indicators
Orange text appears on tweets with paid promo reports:
- "3 reported as paid promo (disclosed)"
- "5 reported as paid promo (undisclosed)"  
- "8 reported as paid promo (disclosed and undisclosed)"

### üíé Profile Page Badges
- Color-coded badges on each report
- Green badge for "Disclosed"
- Red badge for "Undisclosed"
- Separate tabs for Signals and Paid Promo Reports

## üîß Technical Changes

### Database
- Added `disclosure_status` column to `paid_promo_reports` table
- New migration: `008_add_disclosure_status.sql`
- Optimized with indexed queries

### API
- Updated POST `/api/paid-promos/[username]` to accept `disclosureStatus`
- Modified GET `/api/paid-promos/count` to return `{total, disclosed, undisclosed}`

### Extension
- Version bumped to 1.5.0
- Added disclosure status buttons in dialog
- Enhanced tweet indicators with disclosure info
- Removed debug logging for production
