## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend (Deno Deploy)
```bash
# Deno Deploy should auto-deploy from main branch
# Verify deployment at: https://dash.deno.com/projects/signals
```
**Expected**: Backend automatically deploys from GitHub main branch

### Step 2: Run Production Database Migration
```bash
# Connect to production database and run:
cd /Users/trevorthompson/dev/signals
deno run -A scripts/run-migration-008.ts
```

**What this does:**
- Adds `disclosure_status` column to `paid_promo_reports` table
- Sets default value to 'disclosed'
- Creates index for efficient queries
- Adds constraint to ensure only valid values

### Step 3: Verify Migration
```bash
# Verify the migration succeeded:
deno run -A scripts/verify-migration-008.ts
```

**Expected output:**
```
‚úÖ disclosure_status column exists
   Type: text
   Default: 'disclosed'::text
‚úÖ Index idx_paid_promo_disclosure_status exists
```

### Step 4: Test Backend API
```bash
# Test the count endpoint returns proper structure:
curl "https://signals.deno.dev/api/paid-promos/count?tweetUrl=https://x.com/test/status/123"

# Expected response:
# {"total": 0, "disclosed": 0, "undisclosed": 0}
```

### Step 5: Deploy Chrome Extension
1. Share `signals-extension-v1.5.0.zip` with users
2. Provide installation instructions
3. Users reload extension in Chrome

## üìä Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Number of paid promo reports created (daily/weekly)
- Ratio of disclosed vs undisclosed reports
- Number of unique reporters
- API error rates for `/api/paid-promos/*` endpoints
- Extension installation/usage stats

### Database Queries for Monitoring
```sql
-- Total reports by disclosure status
SELECT disclosure_status, COUNT(*) 
FROM paid_promo_reports 
GROUP BY disclosure_status;

-- Reports in last 24 hours
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM paid_promo_reports 
WHERE reported_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours';

-- Most reported users
SELECT twitter_username, COUNT(*) as report_count
FROM paid_promo_reports 
GROUP BY twitter_username 
ORDER BY report_count DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## üêõ Rollback Plan

If issues arise, rollback procedure:

1. **Revert Extension**
   - Redistribute previous version (v1.4.0)
   - Users reload extension

2. **Revert Backend Code**
   ```bash
   git revert 980508f
   git push
   ```

3. **Revert Database** (if necessary)
   ```sql
   -- Remove disclosure status column
   ALTER TABLE paid_promo_reports DROP COLUMN disclosure_status;
   DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_paid_promo_disclosure_status;
   ```

## üìù Release Notes

### What's New in v1.5.0

**Paid Promo Disclosure Status Tracking**

Users can now specify whether a paid promotion is disclosed or undisclosed when reporting:

- **Disclosed**: The promoted content clearly states it's a paid partnership
- **Undisclosed**: The promoted content doesn't mention it's paid

**Features:**
- Easy-to-use toggle buttons in the extension dialog
- Defaults to "Disclosed" to encourage proper disclosure practices
- Tweet indicators show aggregate disclosure status
- Color-coded badges in the UI (green for disclosed, red for undisclosed)
- All data tracked in the database for transparency

**Why This Matters:**
This feature helps the community identify and track undisclosed paid promotions, which can be misleading to investors. By making disclosure status visible, we promote transparency in the crypto space.

## üë• User Communication

### Announcement Template

**Subject**: New Feature: Track Paid Promo Disclosure Status

Hi Signals Community,

We're excited to announce a new feature in Signals v1.5.0 that helps promote transparency around paid promotions!

**What's New:**
When reporting a tweet as a paid promo, you can now specify whether it's:
- ‚úÖ Disclosed (clearly states it's a partnership)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Undisclosed (doesn't mention it's paid)

**Why This Matters:**
Undisclosed paid promotions can mislead investors. By tracking this, we help the community identify content that may not be fully transparent.

**How to Update:**
1. Download the new extension: signals-extension-v1.5.0.zip
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Remove the old version
4. Load the new unpacked extension

**What You'll See:**
Tweets with paid promo reports now show disclosure status like:
- "3 reported as paid promo (disclosed)"
- "5 reported as paid promo (undisclosed)"
- "8 reported as paid promo (disclosed and undisclosed)"

Happy signaling! üéØ
