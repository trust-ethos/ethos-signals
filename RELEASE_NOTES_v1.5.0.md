**Backend Version**: Compatible with main branch (commit 980508f)

## üéâ What's New

### Paid Promo Disclosure Status Tracking

The headline feature of v1.5.0 is the ability to track whether paid promotions are properly disclosed or not.

#### For Users:
When reporting a tweet as a paid promo, you can now specify:
- **Disclosed** ‚úÖ - The content clearly states it's a paid partnership
- **Undisclosed** ‚ö†Ô∏è - The content doesn't mention it's a paid promotion

#### Why This Matters:
Undisclosed paid promotions are a significant issue in the crypto space. They can mislead investors and create unfair market conditions. By tracking disclosure status, the Signals community can:
- Identify accounts that frequently post undisclosed promos
- Reward transparency by highlighting proper disclosures
- Help users make more informed decisions about content credibility

- **UX**: Visual feedback with color-coded styling

### 2. Enhanced Tweet Indicators
- **Format**: "N reported as paid promo (disclosure status)"
